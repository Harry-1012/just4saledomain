This is truly a critical moment of danger and survival. Yet, those who serve in the court are unwaveringly committed internally, and those with loyal aspirations forget themselves externally. They are driven by the memory of the late emperor's exceptional treatment and wish to repay Your Majesty. It is appropriate to open the doors to wise counsel, to illuminate the late emperor's virtues, to restore the spirit of the loyalists, and not to underestimate oneself or distort analogies, lest loyal remonstrances be blocked.",

If there are those who commit crimes or perform acts of loyalty and goodness, they should be judged by the authorities for their merits and punishments, to demonstrate Your Majesty's fairness and justice, avoiding partiality and ensuring consistency in law enforcement both internally and externally.",

Favoring petty people and distancing oneself from wise ministers was the reason for the decline of the Later Han dynasty. When the late emperor was alive, he often discussed this matter with me, always sighing and regretting the times of Emperor Huan and Emperor Ling. Those serving as attendants, secretaries, chief clerks, and aides were all loyal subjects with unwavering integrity. I hope Your Majesty will trust and rely on them, then the prosperity of the Han dynasty can be expected.",
